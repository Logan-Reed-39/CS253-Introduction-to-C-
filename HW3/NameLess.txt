When I drowned,
I was found,
in a new world
of new ground
 
I see lights,
I breath air
There's a  sun
and new life

I am a bird of my fantasy
who's swimming of ecstasy
Became troubled emotive
when uncovered idiosyncrasy

I searched for my voice
and a reason for tears
I only perceived those 
memories of desires

I couldn't see myself in mirror
I had no shadow of glare
I was one
a mind, body pair

I will float in your veins
drizzle past your eyes,
Rest in your dreams,
and sleep though your nights.

Saying you beautiful, was my declaration
Seeing u, is now my imagination
I am gone, not alive
Remember me, when you reside.
